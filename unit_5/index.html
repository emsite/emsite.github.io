<h2> Explore. Wander. Experience. </h2>

<p> Feeling down or uninspired? The world is waiting to be experienced, explored and enjoyed. Follow me on my travels around the world, read stories about some of the experiences I had along the way. Travelling allows you not only to explore new places in the world, but also new places within you - it challenges and changes you as a person and enriches and shapes your life in a way that only few other experiences, like the love of a another person, faith or even sadness and loss can. </p>
